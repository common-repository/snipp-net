The Snipp.net WordPress plug-in works in conjunction with the website Snipp.net and protects WordPress pages so that only paying premium subscribers on Snipp.net gain access to WordPress pages making use of the Snipp.net plug-in.

== Description ==

The Snipp.net WordPress plug-in enables you to become part of Snipp.net's subscription distribution solution.

We distribute 70% of the subscription revenue to you and other publishers. You will receive your pro rata share from each paying subscriber. If a subscriber views only one premium article per month, then you/publisher will receive 100% of the 70%. If subscriber views 10 premium articles per month, then you/publisher(s) receive 10% each of the 70%, and so on.

The plug-in works in conjunction with the website Snipp.net and protects WordPress pages so that only paying premium subscribers on Snipp.net gain access to WordPress pages making use of the Snipp.net plug-in.

The snipp.net service generates links to premium articles with a special access key, which is read by the plugin, after which the plugin informs the snipp.net service about the user viewing the page by the generated link. The following data is sent to the snipp.net service: the unique identifier of the publisher in the snipp.net system; unique identifier of news in the snipp.net system; unique user ID in the snipp.net system; time of visit.
